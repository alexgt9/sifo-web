=================================
Sifo framework is based in the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern. Use the navigation menu and see a list of classes that are included with the SIFO library. Some of this classes are always preloaded by the bootsrap for every execution, you can see which of them are included by default in the file `config/libraries.config.php` of your instance. The rest of them will be automatically included when you use them.
