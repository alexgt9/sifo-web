Download SIFO
=============
There are several ways to get a copy or working copy of [SIFO]. You can download a compressed file or checkout or clone the entire project. The code can be both fetched from SVN and Git.

You need at least **PHP 5.3** to run SIFO. If you use PHP 5.2 you can try an older version (see below).

The code is hosted under [Github] [GH]

Download via tarball
--------------------
If you don't want to mess with the version control systems, [downloading a tarball] is the easiest way to get the code, although is not in its last version:


Clone/fork/download from github
-------------------------------
`RECOMMENDED` either if you want to contribute back or not, here is the latest version of the framework, see [SIFO at Github] [GH]

	# Clone the SIFO project into a folder called "sifo":
	git clone git://github.com/alombarte/SIFO.git sifo

Checkout from subversion
------------------------
If you prefer to work with the [subversion repository] [GC] you can also checkout the project in the URL:

	# Checkout the SIFO project into a folder called "sifo":
	svn checkout http://sifo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sifo

Download SIFO for PHP 5.2
-------------------------
If you still need SIFO running for PHP 5.2 servers you can use the specific 5.2 version.
Please be aware that **support for PHP 5.2 has been discontinued** and the framework won't add more capabilities.

You can find the PHP 5.2 framework here:

 * GIT - Github: <https://github.com/alombarte/SIFO/tags>
 * SVN - Google Code: ``svn checkout http://sifo.googlecode.com/svn/tags/stable-php-5.2 sifo`` (Hosting discontinued)
 * Tarball: [sifo-2.0.1-stable.tar.gz][PHP52tar]
