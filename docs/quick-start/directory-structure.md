Directory structure
===================
When you have downloaded the SIFO code, the directory structure looks like this:

	sifo/
	 |_ docs --> Project documentation
	 |_ instances --> Each web project you create should have a folder inside, we call it the instance
	 |_ libs --> External libraries needed to make your project work (including SIFO)
	 |_ logs --> Directory where the php errors and other stuff is writen
	 |_ public --> Where your apache should point to if you have NO INSTANCES
