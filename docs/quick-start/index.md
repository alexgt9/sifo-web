Quick Start Guide
=================
This document and all the accompanying documents in the navigation menu try to give an overview on how to get your projects started using the SIFO PHP5 Framework.

Quick facts
-----------
The best way to quickly see if SIFO fits your needs is by simply reading some quick facts:

 * SIFO is a **PHP5** framework.
 * Developed with **scaling and performance in mind** (static/dynamic distinction, load balancers, different cache flavours...)
 * Helps you **reuse code** of your different projects (we call it **instances**).
 * You can **run several unrelated projects** with the same code base.
 * Contains **all the [tools]** you need to create a large site with high availability and complex features or just a tiny site.
 * A **powerful debug** or specific libraries for **fast search** using Sphinx or key-value storage.
 * Different environments: development and production.
 * **Well proven**, running since year 2008 and used in a large base of heterogeneous web projects with very different needs and technologies.
 * Powers big sites, some of them with up to **15.000.000 pageviews/month**.
 * Provides a **Model-View-Controller** implementation.
 * Very good for **multilanguage** projects and **SEO optimization** (The framework was formerly known as *seoframework*)
 * Uses popular libraries to resolve problems, although you can use your own.
 * **Nice URLs** with simple controller association.
 * Support for **multiple databases** and other engines.
 * Command line classes to create scripts, cronjobs and batch processes with nice output.
 * Pre-built controllers, managers, models and utilities to ease your work (automatic translators, metadata handling, redirect debugger...)



Getting started
---------------
Here is a list of things you should see to understand and start using the framework:

* First things first: [download] and [install] the framework.
* [Directory structure]: Understanding where you can find every thing.
* [Create an instance] (your project container).
* [Configure Apache] to point to SIFO and add necessary entries to your DNS server or `/etc/hosts` file
* Test your instance and make yourself familiar with it.
* Code your first controller
* Understand the Configuration files

### Video tutorial ###
This is a quick demonstration on how to start working with SIFO: *get the code, create an instance and create the first controller* Watching a video is easier than reading a ton of documentation. It is splitted in two parts (that's what happens when you use demo products!)
