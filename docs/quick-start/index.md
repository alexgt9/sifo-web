Quick Start Guide
=================
This document and all the accompanying documents in the navigation menu try to give an overview on how to get your projects started using the SIFO PHP5 Framework.

Here is a list of things you should see to understand and start using the framework:

* First things first: [download] and [install] the framework.
* [Directory structure]: Understanding where you can find every thing.
* [Create an instance] (your project container).
* [Configure Apache] to point to SIFO and add necessary entries to your DNS server or `/etc/hosts` file
* Test your instance and make yourself familiar with it.
* Code your first controller
* Understand the Configuration files

### Video tutorial ###
This is a quick demonstration on how to start working with SIFO: *get the code, create an instance and create the first controller* Watching a video is easier than reading a ton of documentation. It is splitted in two parts (that's what happens when you use demo products!)

You can also directly open the flash files in a new window:
