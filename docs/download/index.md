Download SIFO
=============
There are several ways to get a copy or working copy of [SIFO]. You can download a compressed file or checkout or clone the entire project. The code can be both fetched from SVN and Git.

You need at least **PHP 5.3** to run SIFO. If you use PHP 5.2 you can try an older version (see below).

The code is hosted under [Github] [GH]

Download via tarball/ZIP
------------------------
If you don't want to mess with the version control systems, [downloading a tarball or zip] is the easiest way to get the code, although is not in its last version:


Clone/fork/download from github `RECOMMENDED`
--------------------------------------------
Either if you want to contribute back or not, here is the latest version of the framework, see [SIFO at Github] [GH]

	# Clone the SIFO project into a folder called "sifo":
	git clone git://github.com/alombarte/SIFO.git sifo

Old PHP 5.2 version (deprecated)
---------------------------------
Sifo 1.9 should not be downloaded or used. Please be aware that **support for PHP 5.2 has been discontinued** and
the framework won't add more capabilities. Current version is very far from this old version and all the documentation
online won't make any sense to you.

In case you want to continue, you can find the latest PHP 5.2 framework here:

 * Package @ Github: <https://github.com/alombarte/SIFO/zipball/sifo-1.9>
